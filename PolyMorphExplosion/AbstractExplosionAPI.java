	 * Polymorphism Lab:
	 * 
	 * Implement the following classes:
	 *  1. AbstractPersonAPI abstract class
	 *  		specify abstract method speak()
	 *  2. Person inheriting from AbstractPersonAPI abstract class
	 *  3. Student inheriting from Person class
	 *  4. Employee inheriting from Person class
	 *  
	 *  Add demo() method to Student class
	 *  	1. instantiate Person and Student objects
	 *  2. demonstrate polymorphism with Person and Student objects in container
	 *  Add demo() method to Employee class
	 *  	1. instantiate Person and Employee objects
	 *  2. demonstrate polymorphism with Person and Employee objects in container
	 *  
	 *  EXTRA: Implement a NEUControlClass
	 *   1. Container for Employee objects
	 *   2. Method to add Employee objects
	 *   3. Method to show all Employee objects
	 *   4. Container for Student objects
	 *   5. Method to add Student objects
